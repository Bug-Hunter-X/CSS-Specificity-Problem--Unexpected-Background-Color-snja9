To resolve this issue, several approaches exist. One is to make the paragraph selector more specific by combining selectors.

```css
.container {
  background-color: blue;
}

.container p {
  background-color: red;
}
```

This ensures the `p` element will now be styled with the red background since `.container p` is more specific than `.container`.

Another approach is to use the `!important` flag, however, this is generally discouraged due to potential maintenance issues:

```css
.container {
  background-color: blue;
}

p {
  background-color: red !important;
}
```

This forces the red background on the `p` element, overriding the `.container` rule.  However, overusing `!important` makes CSS harder to maintain and debug, so this should be considered a last resort.
